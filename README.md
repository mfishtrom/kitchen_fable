Kitchen Fable is a single page app inspired by Open Table, which allows users to search for restaurants in 6 different cities, make reservations and save specific restaurants as they wish. This app was built with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React-Redux for the frontend, using PostgreSQL to manage the database.
